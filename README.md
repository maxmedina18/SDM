Suspension Dynamics Model
This project focuses on simulating various suspension types using physics and programming principles. The goal is to create a dynamic, interactive model that allows users to explore and compare different suspension systems in terms of their performance. The project will start with a local application to demonstrate the core mechanics and visuals of suspension dynamics, with plans to expand it into a web-based application for wider accessibility and interaction.

The model will allow users to adjust parameters such as damping coefficients, spring stiffness, and vehicle load, providing real-time feedback and graphical representations of how these factors influence vehicle behavior on different terrains.

Key features of the project include:

Simulation of multiple suspension types (e.g., MacPherson, double wishbone)
Interactive graphical interface for parameter adjustments
Real-time visualization of suspension travel, force distribution, and vehicle stability
Potential for expansion to a web-based interface
